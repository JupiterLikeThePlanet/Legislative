Stay up to date on current bills

Hi my name is Nathan, and I’m from Washington, DC.

Growing up right outside of the nation’s capital, I was exposed to the importance of one’s civic duty, whether its recycling, going out to vote, or simply staying up to date on current issues.

However, in order to stay informed on what our legislative branch is up to – I often rely on different media sources for what they deem important to report. 

Legislative lets you know what current bills are being discussed on the house or senate floor. Using text mining and analytics, we can derive which keywords may or may not be mentioned in upcoming bills and get a better sense of what our congress is voting on versus what the media might portray.

Using legislative, easily stay up to date with what your local, state, and federal government are working towards.
